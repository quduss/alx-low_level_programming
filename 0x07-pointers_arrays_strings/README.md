# 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
This directory further tests knowledge of pointers, arrays(2d) and strings
1. **0-memset.c** - `C` function that fills memory with a constant byte. It fills the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b` and returns the memory area `s`.
2. **1-memcpy.c** - `C` function that copies memory area. It copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest` and returns a pointer `dest`.
3. **2-strchr.c** - `C` function that locates a character in a string.
4. **3-strspn.c** - `C` function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
5. **4-strpbrk.c** - `C` function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
6. **5-strstr.c** - `C` function that locates a substring.
7. **7-print_chessboard.c** - `C` function that prints each element of a chessboard(2d array of char type).
8. **8-print_diagsums.c** - `C` function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
