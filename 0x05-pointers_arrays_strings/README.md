# 0X05-POINTERS_ARRAYS_STRINGS
This directory is used to test knowledge on the following concepts
- **Pointers**
- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
1. **0-reset_to_98.c** - `C` function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
2. **1-swap.c** - `C` function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. **2-strlen.c** - `C` function that returns the length of a string.
4. **3-puts.c** - `C` function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
5. **4-print_rev.c** - `C` function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
6. **5-rev_string.c** - `C` function that reverses a string.
7. **6-puts2.c** - `C` function that prints even indexed characters of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
8. **7-puts_half.c** - `C` function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line.
9. **8-print_array.c** - `C` function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
10. **9-strcpy.c** - `C` function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. It also returns the pointer to dest.
