# 0x02-functions_nested_loops
This directory is used to test understanding of the following concepts:
- C functions
- loops and nested loops.
1. **0-putchar.c** - `C` program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
2. **1-alphabet.c** - `C` function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. It uses a custom `_putchar` function not more than twice.
3. **2-print_alphabet_x10.c** - C function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. It uses a custom `_putchar` function not more than twice.
4. **3-islower.c** - `C` function that checks if input is a lowercase character.
5. **4-isalpha.c** - `C` function that checks if input is an alphabetic character.
6. **5-sign.c** - `C` function that prints the sign of a number. `+` if number is positive, `-` if number is negative and `0` if number is zero.
7. **6-abs.c** - `C` function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. **7-print_last_digit.c** - `C` function that prints the last digit of a number.
9. **8-24_hours.c** - `C` function that prints every minute of the day starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
10. **9-times_table.c** - `C` function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
11. **10-add.c** - `C` function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. **11-print_to_98.c** - `C` function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
13. **100-times_table.c** - `C` function that prints the n times table, starting with 0. The function doesn't print anything if n is greater than 15 or less than 0.
14. **101-natural.c** - `C` program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
