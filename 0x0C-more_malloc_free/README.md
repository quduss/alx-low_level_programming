# 0x0C-more_malloc_free
This directory further tests understanding of memory allocation and introduces functions `realloc` and `calloc`.
1. **1-string_nconcat.c** - `C` function that concatenates the first string and the first `n` bytes of the second string. It stores the resulting string in a newly allocated memory and returns the pointer to the memory.
2. **2-calloc.c** - `C` function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc and sets each byte to zero.
3. **3-array_range.c** - `C` function that creates an array of integers. The array created contains all the values from min (included) to max (included), ordered from min to max. It returns a pointer to the newly created array.
4. **100-realloc.c** -
