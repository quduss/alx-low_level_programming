1. **0-positive_or_negative.c** - `C` program that prints either `is positive`, `is zero` or `is negative` depending on the random number assigned to variable `n` when it is executed.
2. **1-last_digit.c** - `C` program that prints the last digit of the random number stored in the variable `n`. It also prints either `and is greater than 5`, `and is 0` or `and is less than 6 and not 0` depending on the value of `n`.
3. **2-print_alphabet.c** - `C` program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. It uses only the `putchar` function and not more than twice.
4. **3-print_alphabets.c** - `C` program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. It uses only `putchar` function and not more than three times.
5. **4-print_alphabt.c** - `C` program that prints the alphabet except letters `q` and `e` in lowercase, followed by a new line. It uses only `putchar` and not more than twice.
6. **5-print_numbers.c** - `C` program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. **6-print_numberz.c** - `C` program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. variables of type `char` weren't allowed and `putchar` was to be used and not more than twice.
8. **7-print_tebahpla.c** - `C` program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. It uses only `putchar` and not more than twice.
9. **8-print_base16.c** - `C` program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. It uses only `putchar` and not more than three times.
10. **9-print_comb.c** - `C` program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. It doesn't use variables of type `char`. Numbers are separated by `, ` and `putchar` is used not more than four times.
11. **100-print_comb3.c** - `C` program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. It uses only `putchar` function and not more than five times.
12. **101-print_comb4.c** - `C` program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. It uses only `putchar` and not more than six times.
