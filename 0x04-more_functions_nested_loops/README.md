# 0x04-MORE_FUNCTIONS_NESTED_LOOPS
This directory tests understanding of functions and nested loops in `C`
1. **0-isupper.c** - `C` function that checks for uppercase character and returns 1 if true or 0 if otherwise.
2. **1-isdigit.c** - `C` function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). It returns 1 if input is a digit and 0 otherwise.
3. **2-mul.c** - `C` function that multiplies two integers.
4. **3-print_numbers.c** - `C` function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. It uses the custom function `_putchar` to print.
5. **4-print_most_numbers.c** - `C` function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. numbers `2` and `4` aren't printed. It uses the custom function `_putchar` to print.
6. **5-more_numbers.c** - `C` function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. It uses the custom function `_putchar` to print.
7. **6-print_line.c** - `C` function that draws a straight line in the terminal by printing `_` `n` times.
8. **7-print_diagonal.c** - `C` function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal by printing `\` `n` times.
9. **8-print_square.c** - `C` function that prints a square, followed by a new line. It prints the square by using the character `#`.
10. **9-fizz_buzz.c** - Fizz Buzz test.
11. **10-print_triangle.c** - `C` function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. It uses the `#` character and the `_putchar` function for printing.
