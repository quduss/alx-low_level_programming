# 0x14-bit_manipulation
This directory is used to test understanding of the following concepts:
- Bits and its manipulation.
- Bitwise operators like `&` `^` `|` `>>` `<<` `~`.
1. **0-binary_to_uint.c** - `C` function that converts a binary number stored as a string to an unsigned int.
2. **1-print_binary.c** - `C` function that prints the binary representation of a number.
3. **2-get_bit.c** - `C` function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. Index starts at 0 from the rightmost bit.
4. **3-set_bit.c** - `C` function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. Index starts at 0 from the rightmost bit.
5. **4-clear_bit.c** - `C` function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. Index starts at 0 from the rightmost bit.
6. **5-flip_bits.c** - `C` function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
