# 0x00-hello_world
This project deals with introductory concepts of the `C` language.
1. **0-preprocessor** - script that runs a `C` file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file named `c`. The name of the `C` file is stored in environment varaiable `CFILE`.
2. **1-compiler** - script that compiles a `C` file but does not link. The name of the `C` file is stored in an environment variable `CFILE`.
3. **2-assembler** - script that generates the assembly code of a `C` code and saves it in an output file. The name of the `C` file is stored in an environment variable `CFILE`.
4. **3-name** - script that compiles a `C` file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. The name of the `C` file is stored in an environment variable `CFILE`.
5. **4-puts.c** - `C` program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle` followed by a new line using the `puts` function.
6. **5-printf.c** - `C` program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,` followed by a new line using `printf` function.
7. **6-size.c** - `C` program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
8. **100-intel** - script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a `C` code and saves it in an output file. The name of the `C` file is stored in an environment variable `CFILE`.
